# TypeScript and **webpack** demo (feat. React)

![webpack illustration](src/what-is-webpack.png)

## Intro

> **webpack** is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it
is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

## Getting started

* Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

* Start the application with `npm start`.

* Go to http://localhost:8080/.

* Open your browser's JavaScript console.

## Things to note

* `npm` is used for *all* third-party dependencies (including React and Bootstrap).

* `index.html` is only a small shim that bootstraps the actual application with the bundle generated by **webpack**.

* The application is automatically reloaded when any code is changed, but *all components keep their state*.

* Source maps are available even though the bundling process involves source code processing. Try setting a
breakpoint in TypeScript code and see that it works.

* The tool Typings is used to manage type definitions for libraries.

* HTML templates (see `components`) are expressed using JSX and *are fully type-checked*.

* The main style sheet (`main.less`) declares its dependency on Bootstrap simply by importing it.

* Assets are resolved at compile time. If your refer to a non-existing image, **webpack** will abort with an error.

* Style sheets are included in the application bundle. One less asset for you to include manually and one less
resource for the browser to fetch. Which style sheets to bundle are specified with a simple require, see
`require("./main.less")` in `main.tsx`.
